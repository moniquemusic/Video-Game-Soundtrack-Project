# Video-Game-Soundtrack-Project

This is my capstone project for Springboard's Intro to Data Science course for 2016.

The purpose of this code is to create a database of PC video games with their scores, sales, and soundtrcks.
Scores were collected from metacritic.com, a site that aggregates scores from a multitude of gaming websites. It also receives user reviews directly. Sales estimates were collected from vgchartz.com, and the soundtrack data was collected from Youtube using their API.

I choose to use Youtube as a metric for soundtrack popularity because video game soundtracks are often uploaded to Youtube by fans. Often this is the streamable source that is the easiest to access due to game soundtracks not being covered by, and dare I say not taken seriously by, other streaming platforms.
